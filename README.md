The final of four projects made while learning JavaScript through YouTube with the video JavaScript Programming - Full Course (https://youtu.be/jS4aFq5-91M). Proud to say that I did it once more, with support of the amazing Per Harald Borgen, of course.

Can't wait to learn even more, add publish more projects and learn more more more... and eventually land myself a job in tech!
